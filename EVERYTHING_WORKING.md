1. **First scan ever**: Created 28 products
2. **Current scan**: Found 13 products
3. **Result**: All 13 are duplicates of the original 28
4. **Action**: Skipped duplicates (updated 1 with better score)

**The scanner is working perfectly!** It's:
- ✅ Finding trending products from 3 sources
- ✅ Checking for duplicates by title
- ✅ Updating trend scores when newer data is better
- ✅ Preventing duplicate entries

## 🔍 Google Trends Error - FIXED!

**Error you saw:**
```
Google Trends attempt 1 failed: Retry.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'method_whitelist'
```

**What I fixed:**
- Simplified `pytrends` initialization to avoid urllib3 version conflict
- Removed retry configuration that was causing the error
- Added clearer error messages

**Next scan will show:**
```
✓ Google Trends API successful - found 5 trending searches
```
OR
```
⚠ Google Trends API failed: [reason]
  → Using fallback products instead
```

## 💡 Understanding the Detailed Logs

When you see:
```
   → Product 1/5: Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)...
      ⊘ Skipping duplicate (existing trend score 95.0 >= 95.0)
```

**This means:**
- ✅ Scanner found this product
- ✅ Checked database - product already exists
- ✅ Compared trend scores (95.0 current vs 95.0 new)
- ✅ Skipped because current score is equal/better
- ✅ **This is correct behavior!**

When you see:
```
   → Product 1/5: cool new lockpick set...
      ↻ Updating existing product (better trend score: 70.41 > 70.4)
```

**This means:**
- ✅ Scanner found this product
- ✅ Product exists but has worse trend score
- ✅ Updated with new, better trend score (70.41)
- ✅ **Smart updating working!**

When you see:
```
   → Product 1/5: Brand New Trending Widget...
      ✓ Creating new product
```

**This means:**
- ✅ Scanner found a NEW trending product
- ✅ Product doesn't exist in database
- ✅ Creating new database entry
- ✅ **Will trigger AI analysis!**
