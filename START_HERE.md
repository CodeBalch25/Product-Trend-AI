cd C:\Users\timud\Documents\product-trend-automation

# 2. Verify services running
docker ps --filter "name=product-trend"
# Should show 6 containers: frontend, backend, celery, celery-beat, db, redis

# 3. Check system health
docker logs product-trend-celery --tail 50
docker logs product-trend-backend --tail 50

# 4. Verify feedback loop data
docker exec product-trend-backend python -c "
from models.database import SessionLocal, TrendingKeyword
db = SessionLocal()
count = db.query(TrendingKeyword).count()
print(f'[COMPLETE] Keywords in database: {count}')
db.close()
"

# 5. Access the system

## What This System Does

**Product Trend Automation** - AI-powered platform that:

1. **Discovers** trending products from 7 sources (Amazon, TikTok, Reddit, etc.)
2. **Analyzes** products using 12 AI agents (11 Groq + 1 Perplexity)
3. **Learns** from discoveries via Perplexity feedback loop
4. **Recommends** products with APPROVE/REVIEW/REJECT decisions
5. **Auto-posts** to marketplaces (requires manual approval)

**Key Innovation:** Self-improving feedback loop where Perplexity discovers trending keywords from the web, stores them in the database, and TrendScanner uses them to prioritize future product searches.

---

## Current System State (Snapshot)

### Services Status
```
[RUNNING] 6 Docker containers running

### What's Next
1. Monitor Perplexity automatic discovery (runs every 6 hours)
2. Build frontend product review dashboard
3. Configure platform APIs (Amazon, eBay, TikTok)
4. Implement keyword-based scoring boost
5. Create analytics dashboard

## Verification Checklist

Before starting work, verify:

```bash
# [CHECK] All services running?
docker ps --filter "name=product-trend"

# [CHECK] Database accessible?
docker exec product-trend-backend python -c "from models.database import SessionLocal; db = SessionLocal(); print('[SUCCESS] DB Connected'); db.close()"

# [CHECK] Trending keywords stored?
docker exec product-trend-backend python -c "from models.database import SessionLocal, TrendingKeyword; db = SessionLocal(); print(f'[INFO] Keywords: {db.query(TrendingKeyword).count()}'); db.close()"

# [CHECK] Backend healthy?
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# [CHECK] Recent activity?
docker logs product-trend-celery --tail 20

# If all checks pass, you're ready to work!
```

## Important Notes

### What's Working
- [COMPLETE] All 12 AI agents with enhanced instructions
- [COMPLETE] Perplexity feedback loop (discovery → storage → usage)
- [COMPLETE] TrendScanner loading keywords from database
- [COMPLETE] Automated schedules (every 1hr, 6hr, 15min)
- [COMPLETE] Docker stack stable
- [COMPLETE] All tests passing

### Known Limitations
- [WARNING] Groq rate limits during heavy testing (expected on free tier)
- [WARNING] Platform APIs not configured (Amazon, eBay, TikTok)
- [WARNING] Frontend needs development (product review dashboard)

### Critical Files (Don't Modify Without Understanding)
- `backend/services/ai_analysis/agentic_system.py` - 12 agent system
- `backend/models/database.py` - Database schema
- `backend/tasks/celery_app.py` - Task schedules
- `.env` - API keys (keep secret!)

## Need Help?

### Documentation Priority
1. **Quick question?** → `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
2. **Complete context?** → `PROJECT_STATE.md`
3. **Architecture?** → `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. **AI agents?** → `AGENTIC_AI_SETUP.md`

### Common Issues
- Services not starting? → Check `PROJECT_STATE.md` → Troubleshooting section
- API errors? → Check `.env` file has valid keys
- Database issues? → Run `init_db()` (see QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
