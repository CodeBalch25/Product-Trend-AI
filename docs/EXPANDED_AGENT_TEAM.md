## Implementation Approach

### Option 1: All Agents (11 Total)
- Most comprehensive analysis
- Longer processing time (~15-20 seconds)
- Best for high-value products ($50+)

### Option 2: Selective Agents (Context-Based)
```python
if product.price < 20:
    # Fast team: Core 4 + Pricing + Viral
    agents = [scanner, trend, research, pricing, viral, coordinator]

elif product.price < 50:
    # Standard team: Core 4 + Pricing + Competition + Quality
    agents = [scanner, trend, research, pricing, competition, quality, coordinator]

else:  # High value products
    # Full team: All 11 agents
    agents = ALL_AGENTS
```

### Option 3: Tiered Analysis
1. **Tier 1 (Fast):** Core 4 agents → Quick decision
2. **Tier 2 (Deep):** If uncertain, deploy additional 7 agents
3. **Tier 3 (Expert):** If still uncertain, human review
