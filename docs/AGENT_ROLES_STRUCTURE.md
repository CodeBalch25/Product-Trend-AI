## Expected Quality Improvements

**Before (Generic Prompts):**
```
Keywords: ["trending", "popular", "best", "new", "cool"]

Reasoning: "This product seems popular"
```

**After (Role-Based Prompts):**
```
Keywords: ["noise cancelling earbuds", "wireless ANC headphones",
           "active noise cancellation", "bluetooth 5.3 earbuds",
           "premium audio", "audiophile wireless", "long battery earbuds",
           "sport wireless earbuds"]
Category: "Electronics > Audio > Headphones > True Wireless > Premium"
Reasoning: "Based on semantic analysis of 10,000+ product listings and
           consumer search behavior data, these keywords represent high-intent
           purchase terms with 50K+ monthly searches. Category placement follows

           indicates 25-40 year old professionals with median income $75K+,
